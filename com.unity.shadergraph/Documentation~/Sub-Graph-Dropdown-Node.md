# Sub Graph Dropdown Node


Description
This is a node which enables you to add a custom dropdown menu to Sub Graphs.

It is possible to set up and use a Sub Graph Dropdown node in the same way you use a Keyword Node. The Graph Inspector exposes many of the same properties it does for an enum keyword. However, in this case you use those properties to specify the options that appear in your dropdown.

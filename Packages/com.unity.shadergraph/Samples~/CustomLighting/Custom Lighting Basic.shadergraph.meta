    description: "A basic custom lighting shader that calculates diffuse lighing
      for multiple light sources. In order to reduce the cost of calculations, this
      shader does not support fog, specular, reflections, light cookies, or SSAO,
      but any of these could be added back in if needed. The goal with this one is
      to make the lighting as cheap as possible by leaving out everything but the
      basics. This type of lighting model may be ideal for XR or low-end mobile devices
      where performance is critical.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Custom Lighting shaders:</b>\r\n\u2022
      allow you to edit the lighting model itself directly in the graph to either
      stylize it or make it cheaper.\r\n\u2022 are intended for use in Forward, or
      Forward+ rendering modes. They are not intended to be used in Deferred mode.\r\n\u2022
      can be mixed and matched in your scene, so you might use cheaper lighting models
      on background elements and less important objects to reduce rendering cost,
      and more complex lighting models on foreground elements and hero objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported
      Pipeline(s): URP\r\nActive Target: Unit\r\nVFX Graph Support: disabled"

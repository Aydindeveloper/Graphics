    description: "This custom lighting model is designed to be similar to the main
      lighting used by URP - but it uses a slightly cheaper Blinn model for specular
      highlights. Blinn doesn't look quite as nice, but it should be faster to render
      in most cases.\r\n\r\n<b>Custom Lighting shaders:</b>\r\n\u2022 allow you to
      edit the lighting model itself directly in the graph to either stylize it or
      make it cheaper.\r\n\u2022 are intended for use in Forward, or Forward+ rendering
      modes. They are not intended to be used in Deferred mode.\r\n\u2022 can be
      mixed and matched in your scene, so you might use cheaper lighting models on
      background elements and less important objects to reduce rendering cost, and
      more complex lighting models on foreground elements and hero objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported
      Pipeline(s): URP\r\nActive Target: Unit\r\nVFX Graph Support: disabled"

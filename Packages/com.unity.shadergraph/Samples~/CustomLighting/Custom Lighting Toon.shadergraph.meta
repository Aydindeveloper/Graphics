    description: "This custom lighting model posterizes the lighting so that it has
      the appearance of a cartoon. This is a good example of how lighting can be
      altered in the graph to achieve stylized effects that give your project a unique
      appearance.\r\n\r\n<b>Custom Lighting shaders:</b>\r\n\u2022 allow you to edit
      the lighting model itself directly in the graph to either stylize it or make
      it cheaper.\r\n\u2022 are intended for use in Forward, or Forward+ rendering
      modes. They are not intended to be used in Deferred mode.\r\n\u2022 can be
      mixed and matched in your scene, so you might use cheaper lighting models on
      background elements and less important objects to reduce rendering cost, and
      more complex lighting models on foreground elements and hero objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported
      Pipeline(s): URP\r\nActive Target: Unit\r\nVFX Graph Support: disabled"

    description: "This custom lighting model uses the same lighting formula as the
      Lit URP model - so it's a good place to start if you want to begin with URP
      as is and then make changes.\r\n\r\n<b>Custom Lighting shaders:</b>\r\n\u2022
      allow you to edit the lighting model itself directly in the graph to either
      stylize it or make it cheaper.\r\n\u2022 are intended for use in Forward, or
      Forward+ rendering modes. They are not intended to be used in Deferred mode.\r\n\u2022
      can be mixed and matched in your scene, so you might use cheaper lighting models
      on background elements and less important objects to reduce rendering cost,
      and more complex lighting models on foreground elements and hero objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported
      Pipeline(s): URP\r\nActive Target: Unit\r\nVFX Graph Support: disabled"

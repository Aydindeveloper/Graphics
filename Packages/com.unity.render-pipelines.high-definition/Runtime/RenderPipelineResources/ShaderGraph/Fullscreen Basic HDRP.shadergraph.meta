    description: 'An HDRP Shader Graph template that does simple fullscreen image
      adjustments including tinting, saturation, and contrast.


      Fullscreen
      shaders are intended to be used to apply image adjustments for applications
      like post-process filters. They are not intended to be applied to individual
      meshes.


      To apply a fullscreen shader as a post-process filter, select
      HDRP''s renderer data asset and click the Add Renderer Feature button at the
      bottom of the Inspector. Choose Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature. Then create
      a material from your fullscreen shader and apply it to the Pass Material slot
      of the Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature.
